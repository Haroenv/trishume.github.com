Ever since I was in grade 4 I have been playing the world's best programming
game. The game is highly rewarding, an excellent way to learn programming
and it's even free!

This game has many advantages over other programming video games:

- Like Minecraft, it is open-ended and allows players to set their own
  goals.
- It allows players to use any library and programming language they want to.
- The game can lead to real world rewards and recognition. It has MLG
  players and top gamers can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.
- It can run on any computer regardless of how recently it was made or what OS
  it runs.
- **It even has multiplayer support!** You can play with friends and even post your
  solutions to the puzzles online.

Have you guessed what game it is yet? Does it sound interesting?

The game is called "Just Friggin Program" and it works like this:

1. Think of a program you would like to write.
2. Use the internet to learn things.
3. Write the program!
4. **You beat the level!** Repeat for the next level.

I am now 17 and I have gotten a lot of fun out of playing this game for the last
8 years. I have learned everything I know about programming through playing and I'm sure many other programmers have too.
The best part is I have ended up with a [portfolio of cool projects](http://github.com/trishume) while players
of other games just have their "levels completed" screen to show for it.

*Instead of introducing children to brand new 3D "learn-to-program" games I suggest
the oldest game of them all as the best way to teach kids to programming.*
