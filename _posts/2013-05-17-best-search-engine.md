There are many different comparisons of
search engine results out there but I thought I would do one specifically geared
towards the audience I identify with: programmers.

Do note that these tests are not rigorous and are based on my
observations of which search engine delivers the best results from a
programmer's perspective for a number of programming related searches.

The tests were conducted using Google Chrome in Incognito mode while signed out
of any accounts I had with the site in question.

I will be comparing the following search engines:

- [Google](http://google.com/)
- [Bing](http://bing.com/)
- [DuckDuckGo](http://duckduckgo.com/): This will be particularly interesting since DDG has a number of
  features geared towards geeks and programmers.
- [Samuru](http://samuru.com/): A cool new search engine based on natural language processing.

## 1. Slate

Slate is a window management tool for OSX which I have [written about before](/howto/2012/11/19/using-slate/). The correct first result should probably be Slate magazine but the geeky result I am looking for is the window manager. Since Slate is not as popular as my other search terms I threw this one in as a tough start to the comparison.

### Results
Google actually got it as the second result! I was so stunned by this that I
thought Google was tracking me even with incognito. But I got one of my non-geeky
friends to Google it and he got it as a result as well.

All the other search engines returned the magazine first and then the rock.

### Winner
Google by a long shot! I only tried this one because I thought none of them
would get it.

## 2. Chef

If a programmer searches for "Chef" they are probably referring to the
automation platform by Opscode. What I am looking for is results that talk about
Chef, preferably from OpsCode.

### Results
All search engines had OpsCode Chef on the first page but only some had it in
the top 3.

![Bing  ]({{PAGE_ASSETS}}/1-bing.png)
![DDG   ]({{PAGE_ASSETS}}/1-ddg.png)
![Samuru]({{PAGE_ASSETS}}/1-samuru.png)

### Winner
Google was the only search engine that returned Chef in the top 3 results and it
put it as the first result.


## 3. Node

This is an interesting one since even as a programmer it is tough to figure out
if the correct result is a networking node or Node.js.

### Results

![Bing  ]({{PAGE_ASSETS}}/2-bing.png)
![DDG   ]({{PAGE_ASSETS}}/2-ddg.png)
![Samuru]({{PAGE_ASSETS}}/2-samuru.png)

### Winner
Depends on your personal preferences. Google and Samuru put nodejs.org first and
Bing and DDG put networking nodes first. Bing is the only one that does not
mention both.

## 4. Underscore

Should refer to underscore.js. No screenshots for this one because I have
already made you scroll too much.

**Google**: 2/3 including top result are underscore.js
**DuckDuckGo**: 1/3
**Bing**: 0/3
**Samuru**: Samuru gave underscore.js as third result on first search but
because of the way the engine works it gave 3 articles about the character 30s
later after it had done more processing.

## 5. Ruby

Interestingly, every search engine got the Ruby language as the top result
except for Bing, which gave the gem as the top result.

## Overall Winner

Google is the only search engine that returned the results that a programmer
would be looking for every time. It seems the worst of the 4 search engines was
Bing, which got many things and even something as simple as Ruby wrong.
