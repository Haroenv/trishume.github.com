Recently I gave a full length talk at [Ottawa Ruby](http://ottawaruby.ca/) on highlights of the Ruby standard library. It has elements suited to both beginner and advanced Rubyists.

The Ruby standard library is huge and awesome and this talk was designed to show off some of the cool parts of it that are helpful in everyday Ruby programming, and some that are mostly just useful for trivia.

I gave the talk on June 24, 2014.
