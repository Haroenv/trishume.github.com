I have attended the Ottawa Group of Ruby Enthusiasts (<http://ottawaruby.ca/>) for
about a year now. It has been a great place to meet other Ruby developers and
learn interesting things.

The group normally has a main speaker who gives a long talk and one or two 10 minute
lightning talks punctuated by breaks to eat pizza and talk. The main talk is
normally over Skype and the lightning talks are done by volunteers from the group.

I have given two lighning talks on topics which I believed I might know more
than other members. Both talks went well and I've decided to post the slides.
Be aware that I did do a significant amount of talking so you can't get the
whole message from just the slides, but they are better than nothing.

## Ruby + Programming Contests

The first talk I did was on writing programming contests in Ruby. I write lots
of programming contests and have tried using a couple different languages for
them but keep coming back to Ruby.

## Ruby > Shell Scripts

My most recent talk which I gave last meeting was on using Ruby as a scripting
language to automate repetetive tasks.

## Developing a Gem in 20 Minutes

I live coded a simple Ruby gem using Bundler in 20 minutes and explained
some tricks and how easy it was to write Ruby Gems.

## Improv lighting Talk

I recently gave an improvised lightning talk prompted by the lack of other
lighting talks called "How to do a lightning talk." I talked about choosing a
topic that you feel you have unique knowledge of to give you more confidence and
how all that was really important was the confidence to go up there. Everything
else would work itself out.
